# PCAP_Lab

## Objective

Conduct PCAP analysis via Wireshark and provide a report on attack vectors used and various IOCs associated with malware infection.

### Skills Learned

- PCAP Analysis
- Detailed understanding of web traffic components as they relate to the OSI model

  
### Tools Used

- Wireshark
- NMAP

### Steps

**1.** Created custom columns and filters to make data more legible.<br>

###

**2.** Tried filtering for DHCP and NetBios frames to find host name. Only the DHCP discover frame contained that info.

###
  - I subsequently enabled name resolution in the view menu to keep the host name visible as I continued looking through the PCAP. filtering for NetBios frames also provides the hostname.
  - I was also able to get the device's MAC Address from the Frames (00:60:52:b7:33:0f).

**3.** First thing to note in the PCAP was that after the user navigated to oceriesfornot.top, a DNS query was made to another domain: antnosience.com at IP 157.245.142.66

###

**4.** I needed more information on what exactly between the TCP 3-way handsahke and the DNS query, so I decided to update my filter to capture all HTTP/1.1 traffic.

###
The screenshot above that the user downloaded a package from 188.166.118. 
###
**5.** Next step was to export all HTTP objects to take a closer look at them. A total of 2 objects were exported from the object list. In order to learn more about each object, I spun up my Linux VM to check attributes via the CLI.

###
I checked the SHA256 hash value of the file and uploaded it to TotalVirus.com. It returned the results below:

###
Checking the various file names for additional info I noticed the following:

####
I then conducted a search for the **IcedID** malware in the MITRE database. It returned the following:
###
![2024-03-25 11_48_07-IcedID, Software S0483 _ MITRE ATT CKÂ®](https://github.com/Benrosan/PCAP_Lab/assets/160042310/89ed2276-b31d-4cef-82eb-c8725b3cf234)
###
Among other things, IceID uses HTTPS to reach out to C2 servers.
###
**6.** Another HTTP Get request was made to this potentially malicious domain.

###
The file downloaded was .der file, indicating it was a certificate. It's possible that this may be some sort of self-signed certificate designed to facilitate a Man-in-the-Middle attack via proxies, which would be consistent with some IcedID attack vectors.<br>
###
**7.** Upon further investigation, it looks like the host was redirected to various malicious sites, which ultimately led to the downloading of the certificates.
